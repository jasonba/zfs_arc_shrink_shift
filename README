This is a program that will advise upon the correct value to set for the 
/etc/system based tunable zfs_arc_shrink_shift, eg:

set zfs:zfs_arc_shrink_shift = 9


Build guidelines
----------------
There are various options for compiling this program:

1) Normal build

$ make clean
$ make zfs_arc_shrink_shift


2) Debug build 

Dumps out shift variable and memory size after converting from input arguments
which is my way of ensuring that I've got the C code right.

$ make clean
$ make debug 


3) Cleaning up

$ make clean
