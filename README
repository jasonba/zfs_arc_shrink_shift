zfs_arc_shrink_shift
====================

Purpose
-------
This is a program that will advise upon the correct value to set for the 
/etc/system based tunable zfs_arc_shrink_shift, eg:

set zfs:zfs_arc_shrink_shift = 9

You need to supply the amount of memory the system has installed and it will
tell you how much the system will attempt to shrink the ARC by during a 
memory event.

In the early days of NexentaStor, this used to default to 5, however as memory
sizes increased the amount that each shrink event had to process also started
to increase, often into the GB range.
This lead to the system stalling whilst the ARC was shrunk and random latency
for clients access the shares.

Clearly it makes more sense to shrink less memory, more often than trying to
shrink large amounts of memory infrequently.


How to run
----------
If you run this program and tell it how much memory you have, it will advise
what value you need to set for the zfs_arc_shrink_shift tunable, eg:

$ ./zfs_arc_shrink_shift 192
System has 192 GB memory
shiftsize = 5
zfs_arc_shrink_shift (min) value = 5
tofree (min)= 6112 MB
zfs_arc_shrink_shift (max) value = 10
tofree (max)= 191 MB

We can see that it's advising you set a value of 10 for a system with 192GB
of RAM.


Additional
----------
On NexentStor appliances you no longer need to manually set this.
A script will determine the amount of memory installed and tune this 
dynamically.  This makes more sense as appliances can have more memory 
installed and a tunable that was hard coded several years ago when memory 
was smaller, no longer makes sense now.





Build guidelines
----------------
There are various options for compiling this program:

1) Pick the Makefile according to the platform you're compiling this on
   and then create an appropriate soft link.

   There are Makefiles supplied for MacOS, Linux and Solaris/Illumos.

For example:

$ rm Makefile
$ ln -s Makefile.MacOSX Makefile

2) Normal build

$ make clean
$ make zfs_arc_shrink_shift


3) Cleaning up

$ make clean
